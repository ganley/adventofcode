# Day 22

[Puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22)

Strangely, this isn't the first time I've written code to play this game
(the nonrecursive part-1 version). Some years ago I wrote code to play the
kind with a normal deck of cards, in order to use simulation to assess
how likely it is to be dealt hands that result in an infinitely looping game.

Anyway...

sample.txt -> aoc22.py -> 306 (part 1) and 291 (part 2)

input.txt -> aoc22.py -> 35005 (part 1) and 32751 (part 2)
