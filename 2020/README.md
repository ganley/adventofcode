[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2020

New Python tricks I learned during this AoC:

 * This is legal: `if 13 <= x <= 19:`
 * f-strings: `print(f"There are {n} lights")`
 * `for` and `while` can have an `else` that executes only if the loop completes
   normally (no `break`)
 * `try` can also have an `else` that executes if no exception occurs
 * `@property`
 * The "walrus operator" (`:=`)

I didn't actually need to apply all of those for AoC, but I happened to read
Eugene Huang's excellent "Pragmatic Python" Jupyter notebooks this month too.
