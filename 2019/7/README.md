# Day 7

[Puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/7)

Part 1 (irrelevant output omitted):

```
$ ./aoc2019_7a part1_sample1.txt 
4 3 2 1 0:
high = 43210

$ ./aoc2019_7a part1_sample2.txt 
0 1 2 3 4:
high = 54321

$ ./aoc2019_7a part1_sample3.txt 
1 0 4 3 2:
high = 65210

$ ./aoc2019_7a input.txt 
0 3 4 2 1:
high = 75228
```

Huge refactor between part 1 and part 2.

Part 2:

```
$ ./aoc2019_7b part2_sample1.txt
high = 139629729
$ ./aoc2019_7b part2_sample2.txt
high = 18216
$ ./aoc2019_7b input.txt
high = 79846026
```
