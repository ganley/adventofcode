I just did this the inefficient brute-force way.

I've heard people say that the median is the solution for part 1.
That makes intuitive sense, and apparently it works, but I don't quite
grok why.

There is definitely a clean analytical solution to part 2, which is
almost just sum of squares - thus, the solution is simple calculus.
