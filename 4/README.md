# Day 4

aoc4a.py -> sample1.txt -> 2

aoc4a.py -> input.txt -> 200

aoc4b.py -> sample1.txt -> still 2 (not useful)

aoc4b.py -> sample2.txt -> 4 (first 4 invalid, last 4 valid)

aoc4b.py -> input.txt -> 116

I realized later that even `hgt` can be done as a (only slightly ugly) regex,
but I'm going to leave it this way.
